# Streamlining_Employee_Data_Python

In this project, I import employee and Human Resources data in CSV, Excel, and JSON formats. 
I then merge all the data into a single DataFrame before cleaning it and exporting the results into a single CSV file. 

SKILLS: Importing and Cleaning Data, Data Manipulation, Using DataFrames to read and merge data from different sources

TECHNOLOGY: Python, Pandas 

DATASETS: [office_addresses.csv](https://github.com/NaFatimata/Streamlining_Employee_Data_Python/files/9626228/office_addresses.csv)
          [employee_information.xlsx](https://github.com/NaFatimata/Streamlining_Employee_Data_Python/files/9626229/employee_information.xlsx)
          Employee roles (.JSON): {
  "A2R5H9":
  {
    "title": "CEO",
    "monthly_salary": "$4500",
    "team": "Leadership"
  },
  "H8K0L6":
  {
    "title": "CFO",
    "monthly_salary": "$4500",
    "team": "Leadership"
  },
  "G4R7V0":
